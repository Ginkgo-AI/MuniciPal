# Public Records Request Policy

## Section 1: Right of Access

All persons have the right to inspect and obtain copies of public records maintained by the municipality, in accordance with the State Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The municipality is committed to transparency and shall make records available promptly and without unreasonable delay.

A public record is defined as any document, photograph, recording, or other material, regardless of format, that is created or maintained by the municipality in connection with the transaction of official business.

## Section 2: Requesting Records

Public records requests may be submitted in any of the following ways:

1. **In person** at the City Clerk's Office, 100 Main Street, First Floor, during business hours (Monday through Friday, 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM).
2. **By mail** addressed to: City Clerk, FOIA Requests, 100 Main Street, Anytown, ST 00000.
3. **By email** to foia@municipality.gov.
4. **Online** through the municipal website's Public Records Request Portal.

While a written request is preferred, the municipality will accept and process verbal requests. All requests should include sufficient detail to identify the records sought, including approximate dates, subject matter, and the department likely to hold the records.

Requesters are not required to state a reason for the request or disclose their identity unless the request involves records about themselves that require identity verification.

## Section 3: Response Timeline

The City Clerk shall acknowledge receipt of a public records request within three business days. The municipality shall provide the requested records or a written denial within five business days of the acknowledgment.

If the request requires additional time due to the volume or complexity of the records sought, the municipality may extend the response period by an additional ten business days. The requester shall be notified in writing of any such extension, including the reason for the delay and the expected completion date.

## Section 4: Fees

The municipality may charge reasonable fees for the actual cost of reproducing records:

- Paper copies (letter or legal size): $0.25 per page.
- Oversized copies or blueprints: $2.00 per page.
- Electronic media (CD/USB): $5.00 per disc or drive.
- Certified copies: $1.00 per page in addition to reproduction costs.

If the estimated cost of fulfilling a request exceeds $25.00, the requester will be notified and must authorize the expenditure before work proceeds. A deposit of 50% may be required for requests estimated to exceed $100.00.

The first $5.00 of any request is waived. Fees may be waived entirely if the request is determined to be in the public interest and disclosure primarily benefits the general public.

## Section 5: Exemptions and Denials

Certain records are exempt from disclosure under the State FOIA, including but not limited to:

1. Personnel records and medical files of employees, except salary and position information.
2. Records related to pending litigation or attorney-client privileged communications.
3. Law enforcement investigatory records that would interfere with ongoing investigations.
4. Trade secrets or proprietary business information submitted by private entities.
5. Records whose disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
6. Draft documents and inter-agency memoranda that are deliberative in nature.

If a request is denied in whole or in part, the City Clerk shall provide a written explanation citing the specific exemption(s) applicable. The requester may appeal a denial to the municipal FOIA Appeals Officer within 30 days.

Appeals shall be decided within ten business days. If the appeal is denied, the requester may seek judicial review in the State Superior Court.
