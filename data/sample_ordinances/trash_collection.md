# Chapter 8.16 - SOLID WASTE AND RECYCLING COLLECTION

## 8.16.010 - Residential Collection Service

All single-family dwellings and multi-family dwellings up to four units are required to use the municipal trash and recycling collection service. The city will provide one 96-gallon refuse cart and one 96-gallon recycling cart per dwelling unit.

Residents must place their carts at the curb no earlier than 6:00 PM the night before their scheduled collection day and remove them from the curb by 8:00 PM on the collection day. Carts must be placed at least three feet apart and away from vehicles, mailboxes, and utility poles to accommodate automated collection trucks.

## 8.16.020 - Establishing New Service

To establish new municipal trash service, residents must contact the Public Works Department Utility Billing Division at 555-0199 or visit the city's self-service portal at www.cityofexample.gov/utilities. 

New accounts require a one-time activation fee of $35.00, which will be billed on the first monthly statement. Basic residential collection service is billed at $24.50 per month.

## 8.16.030 - Bulk Waste and Yard Debris

Bulk waste items (furniture, appliances) that do not fit in the provided carts may be collected by scheduling a special pickup. Residents are entitled to two free bulk pickups per calendar year. Additional pickups are subject to a $50.00 fee per scheduled stop.

Yard debris must be placed in biodegradable paper bags or bundled (not exceeding 4 feet in length and 50 pounds in weight). Yard debris is collected on the same day as recycling, occurring on alternating weeks.
