## Section 3: Inspection Process

The following inspections are required during the course of permitted construction:

1. **Foundation Inspection**: After excavation, forms, and reinforcement are in place but before concrete is poured.
2. **Framing Inspection**: After all framing, fire-blocking, and bracing are in place and all rough-in for plumbing, mechanical, and electrical has been completed.
3. **Insulation Inspection**: After insulation is installed but before interior wall covering is applied.
4. **Final Inspection**: After all work is complete and the structure is ready for occupancy.

Inspection requests must be made at least 24 hours in advance by calling the inspection hotline at 555-0200 or submitting a request through the online portal. Inspections are conducted Monday through Friday between 9:00 AM and 3:30 PM.

If work fails inspection, the contractor shall correct all noted deficiencies and schedule a re-inspection. A re-inspection fee of $75 applies for each subsequent inspection of previously failed items.

Building permits expire 180 days from the date of issuance if work has not commenced. Extensions of up to 90 days may be granted upon written request submitted before the permit expiration date.

No structure shall be occupied until a Certificate of Occupancy has been issued by the Building Official following a successful final inspection.
